# Computer-Vision-Coursework

This was my submission for my Computer Vision coursework as per my final year at uni. 
This was my first use of C++ and was developed on Visual Studio Community 2015 using OpenCV 2.4.13.6 as per the lecturers requirements.
The aim of this coursework was to test different image detectors, extractors and classifiers to see which combination is the most effective. 
This program generates a Motion History Image from video clips fed into the program which the components use to train and test.
